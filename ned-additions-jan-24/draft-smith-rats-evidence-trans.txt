                 draft-smith-rats-evidence-trans-latest

Abstract

   Remote Attestation Procedures (RATS) enable Relying Parties to assess
   the trustworthiness of a remote Attester and therefore to decide
   whether to engage in secure interactions with it - or not.  Evidence
   about trustworthiness can be rather complex and it is deemed
   unrealistic that every Relying Party is capable of the appraisal of
   Evidence.  Therefore that burden is typically offloaded to a
   Verifier.  In order to conduct Evidence appraisal, a Verifier
   requires fresh Evidence from an Attester.  Before a Verifier can
   appraise Evidence it may require transformation to an internal
   representation.  This document specifies Evidence transformation
   methods for DICE and SPDM formats to the CoRIM internal
   representation.

1.  Introduction

   Remote Attestation Procedures (RATS) enable Relying Parties to assess
   the trustworthiness of a remote Attester and therefore to decide
   whether to engage in secure interactions with it - or not.  Evidence
   about trustworthiness can be rather complex and it is deemed
   unrealistic that every Relying Party is capable of the appraisal of
   Evidence.  Therefore that burden is typically offloaded to a
   Verifier.  In order to conduct Evidence appraisal, a Verifier
   requires fresh Evidence from an Attester.  Before a Verifier can
   appraise Evidence it may require transformation to an internal
   representation.  This document specifies Evidence transformation
   methods for DICE and SPDM formats to the CoRIM internal
   representation.

1.1.  Terminology and Requirements Language

   This document uses terms and concepts defined by the RATS
   architecture.  For a complete glossary see Section 4 of [RFC9334].
   Addintional RATS architecture is found in
   [I-D.ietf-rats-endorsements].  RATS architecture terms and concepts
   are always referenced as proper nouns, i.e., with Capital Letters.

   In this document, an Evidence structure describes an external
   representation.  There are many possible Evidence structures
   including [I-D.ietf-rats-eat] The bytes composing the CoRIM data
   structure are the same either way.

   The terminology from CoRIM [I-D.ietf-rats-corim], CBOR [STD94], CDDL
   [RFC8610] and COSE [STD96] applies.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Verifier Reconciliation

   This specification assumes the reader is familiar with Verifier
   Reconsiliation as described in [I-D.ietf-rats-corim].  It describes
   how a Verifier should process the CoRIM to enable CoRIM authors to
   convey their intended meaning and how a Verifier reconciles its
   various inputs.  Evidence is one of its inputs.  The Verifier is
   expected to create an internal representation from an external
   representation.  By using an internal representation, the Verifier
   processes Evidence inputs such that they can be appraised
   consistently.

   This specification describes how Evidence in DICE [DICE.Attest], SPDM
   [SPDM], and concise evidence [TCG.CE] formats are transformed into
   the CoRIM [I-D.ietf-rats-corim] internal representation.  If other
   internal representations exist, a similar specification may be
   required that transforms Evidence to some other internal
   representation.

3.  Transforming SPDM Evidence

   This section defines how Evidence from SPDM [SPDM] is transformed
   into a format where it can be added to an appraisal claims set.  A
   Verifier supporting SPDM format Evidence should implement this
   section.

   The TCG DICE Concise Evidence Binding for SPDM specification [TCG.CE]
   describes the process by which measurements in an SPDM Measurement
   Block are converted to Evidence suitable for matching using the rules
   below.  The SPDM measurements are converted to concise-evidence which
   has a format that is similar to CoRIM triples-map (their semantics
   follows the matching rules described above).

4.  Transforming DICE Evidence

   This section defines how Evidence from DICE [DICE.Attest] is
   transformed into a format where it can be added to an appraisal
   claims set.  A Verifier supporting DICE format Evidence should
   implement this section.

   DICE Evidence appears in certificates in the TcbInfo or MultiTcbInfo
   extension.  Each TcbInfo, and each entry in the MultiTcbInfo, is
   converted to an endorsed-triple-record using the rules in this
   section.  In a MultiTcbInfo each entry in the sequence is treated as
   independent and translated into a separate Evidence object.

   The Verifier SHALL translate each field in the TcbInfo into a field
   in the created endorsed-triple-record

   *  The TcbInfo type field SHALL be copied to the field named
      environment-map / class / class-id and tagged with tag #6.111

   *  The TcbInfo vendor field SHALL be copied to the field named
      environment-map / class / vendor

   *  The TcbInfo model field SHALL be copied to the field named
      environment-map / class / model

   *  The TcbInfo layer field SHALL be copied to the field named
      environment-map / class / layer

   *  The TcbInfo index field SHALL be copied to the field named
      environment-map / class / index

   *  The TcbInfo version field SHALL be translated to the field named
      measurement-map / mval / version / version

   *  The TcbInfo svn field SHALL be copied to the field named
      measurement-map / mval / svn

   *  The TcbInfo fwids field SHALL be translated to the field named
      measurement-map / mval / digests

      -  Each digest within fwids is translated to a CoMID digest
         object, with an appropriate algorithm identifier

   *  The TcbInfo flags field SHALL be translated to the field named
      measurement-map / mval / flags

      -  Each flag is translated independently

   *  The TcbInfo vendorInfo SHALL shall be copied to the field named
      measurement-map / mval / raw-value

   If there are multiple endorsed-triple-records with the same
   environment-map then they MUST be merged into a single entry.  If the
   measurement-values-map fields in Evidence triples have conflicting
   values then the Verifier MUST fail validation.

5.  Transforming Concise Evidence

6.  Security and Privacy Considerations

   There are no security and privacy considerations.

7.  IANA Considerations

   There are no IANA considerations.

Abstract

   Remote Attestation Procedures (RATS) enable Relying Parties to assess
   the trustworthiness of a remote Attester to decide if continued
   interaction is warrented.  Evidence structures can vary making
   appraisals challenging for Verifiers.  Verifiers need to understand
   Evidence encoding formats and some of the Evidence semantics to
   appraise it.  Consequently, Evidence may require format
   transformation to an internal representation that preserves original
   semantics.  This document specifies Evidence transformation methods
   for DiceTcbInfo, concise evidence, and SPDM measurements block
   structures.  These Evidence structures are converted to the CoRIM
   internal representation and follow CoRIM defined appraisal
   procedures.

1.  Introduction

   Remote Attestation Procedures (RATS) [RFC9334] enable Relying Parties
   to assess the trustworthiness of a remote Attester to decide if
   continued interaction is warrented.  Evidence structures can vary
   making appraisals challenging for Verifiers.  Verifiers need to
   understand Evidence encoding formats and some of the Evidence
   semantics to appraise it.  Consequently, Evidence may require format
   transformation to an internal representation that preserves original
   semantics.  This document specifies Evidence transformation methods
   for DiceTcbInfo [DICE.Attest], concise evidence [TCG.CE], and SPDM
   measurements block [SPDM] structures.  These Evidence structures are
   converted to the CoRIM internal representation (Section 2.1
   [I-D.ietf-rats-corim]) and follow CoRIM defined appraisal procedures
   (Section 8 [I-D.ietf-rats-corim]).

1.1.  Terminology

   This document uses terms and concepts defined by the RATS
   architecture.  For a complete glossary.  See Section 4 of [RFC9334].
   Addintional RATS architecture and terminology is found in
   [I-D.ietf-rats-endorsements].  RATS architecture terms and concepts
   are always referenced as proper nouns, i.e., with Capital Letters.
   Additional terminology from CoRIM [I-D.ietf-rats-corim],
   [DICE.CoRIM], CBOR [STD94], CDDL [RFC8610] and COSE [STD96] may also
   apply.

   In this document, Evidence structures define the "external
   representation".  There are many possible Evidence structures
   including those mentioned above.

   The CoRIM specification defines an "internal representation" for
   Evidence (Section 8.2.1.3 [I-D.ietf-rats-corim]).  This document
   defines mapping functions from external to internal representations
   also known as "transformation".

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Verifier Reconciliation

   This document assumes the reader is familiar with Verifier
   Reconsiliation as described in Section 2 of [I-D.ietf-rats-corim].
   It describes how a Verifier should process the CoRIM to enable CoRIM
   authors to convey their intended meaning and how a Verifier
   reconciles its various inputs.  Evidence is one of its inputs.  The
   Verifier is expected to create an internal representation from an
   external representation.  By using an internal representation, the
   Verifier processes Evidence inputs such that they can be appraised
   consistently.

   This document defines format transformations for Evidence in DICE
   [DICE.Attest], SPDM [SPDM], and concise evidence [TCG.CE] formats
   that are transformed into a Verifier's internal representation.  This
   document uses the CoMID internal representation (Section 8.2.1 of
   [I-D.ietf-rats-corim]) as the transformation target.  Other internal
   representations are possible but out of scope for this document.

3.  Transforming DICE Certificate Extension Evidence

   This section defines how Evidence from an X.509 certificate [RFC5280]
   containing a DICE certificate extension [DICE.Attest] is transformed
   into an internal representation that can be processed by Verifiers.

   Verifiers supporting the DICE certificate Evidence extensions SHOULD
   implement this transformation.

3.1.  DiceTcbInfo Transformation

   This section defines transformation methods for DICE certificate
   extensions DiceTcbInfo, DiceMultiTcbInfo, and DiceMultiTcbInfoComp.

   These extensions are identified by the following object identifiers:

   *  tcg-dice-TcbInfo - "2.23.133.5.4.1"

   *  tcg-dice-MultiTcbInfo - "2.23.133.5.4.5"

   *  tcg-dice-MultiTcbInfoComp - "2.23.133.5.4.8"

   Each DiceTcbInfo entry in a MultiTcbInfo is converted to a CoRIM ECT
   (see Section 8.2.1 of [I-D.ietf-rats-corim]) using the transformation
   steps in this section.  Each DiceMultiTcbInfo entry is independent of
   the others such that each is transformed to a separate ECT entry.  A
   list of Evidence ECTs (i.e., ae = [ + ECT]) is constructed using
   CoRIM attestation evidence internal representation (see
   Section 8.2.1.1 of [I-D.ietf-rats-corim]).  Each DiceMultiTcbInfoComp
   entry is converted to a DiceMultiTcbInfo entry then processed as a
   DiceMultiTcbInfo.

   For each DiceTcbInfo (DTI) entry in a DiceMultiTcbInfo allocate an
   ECT structure.

   Step 1.  An ae entry is allocated.

   Step 2.  The cmtype of the ECT is set to evidence.

   Step 3.  The DiceTcbInfo (DTI) entry populates the ae ECT.

   i  The DTI entry populates the ae ECT environment-map

      *copy*(DTI.type, ECT.environment.environment-map.class-
         map.class-id).  The binary representation of DTI.type MUST be
         equivalent to the binary representation of class-id without the
         CBOR tag.

      *copy*(DTI.vendor, ECT.environment.environment-map.class-
         map.vendor).

      *copy*(DTI.model, ECT.environment.environment-map.class-
         map.model).

      *copy*(DTI.layer, ECT.environment.environment-map.class-
         map.layer).

      *copy*(DTI.index, ECT.environment.environment-map.class-
         map.index).

   ii The DTI entry populates the ae ECT elemenet-list.

      *copy*(DTI.version, ECT.element-list.element-map.measurement-
         values-map.version-map.version).

      *copy*(DTI.svn, ECT.element-list.element-map.measurement-
         values-map.svn).

      *copy*(DTI.vendorInfo, ECT.element-list.element-
         map.measurement-values-map.raw-value).

      Foreach FWID in FWIDLIST: *copy*(DTI.FWID.digest, ECT.element-
         list.element-map.measurement-values-map.digests.digest.val).

      Foreach FWID in FWIDLIST: *copy*(DTI.FWID.hashAlg, ECT.element-
         list.element-map.measurement-values-map.digests.digest.alg).

   iiiThe DTI entry populates the ae ECT elemenet-list.flags.  Foreach
      _f_ in DTI.OperationalFlags and each _m_ in
      DTI.OperationalFlagsMask:

      If _m_.notConfigured = 1 AND _f_.notConfigured = 1;
         *set*(ECT.element-list.element-map.measurement-values-
         map.flags.is-configured = FALSE).

      If _m_.notConfigured = 1 AND _f_.notConfigured = 0;
         *set*(ECT.element-list.element-map.measurement-values-
         map.flags.is-configured = TRUE).

      If _m_.notSecure = 1 AND _f_.notSecure = 1; *set*(ECT.element-
         list.element-map.measurement-values-map.flags.is-secure =
         FALSE).

      If _m_.notSecure = 1 AND _f_.notSecure = 0; *set*(ECT.element-
         list.element-map.measurement-values-map.flags.is-secure =
         TRUE).

      If _m_.recovery = 1 AND _f_.recovery = 1; *set*(ECT.element-
         list.element-map.measurement-values-map.flags.is-recovery =
         FALSE).

      If _m_.recovery = 1 AND _f_.recovery = 0; *set*(ECT.element-
         list.element-map.measurement-values-map.flags.is-recovery =
         TRUE).

      If _m_.debug = 1 AND _f_.debug = 1; *set*(ECT.element-
         list.element-map.measurement-values-map.flags.is-debug =
         FALSE).

      If _m_.debug = 1 AND _f_.debug = 0; *set*(ECT.element-
         list.element-map.measurement-values-map.flags.is-debug = TRUE).

      If _m_.notReplayProtected = 1 AND _f_.notReplayProtected = 1;
         *set*(ECT.element-list.element-map.measurement-values-
         map.flags.is-replay-protected = FALSE).

      If _m_.notReplayProtected = 1 AND _f_.notReplayProtected = 0;
         *set*(ECT.element-list.element-map.measurement-values-
         map.flags.is-replay-protected = TRUE).

      If _m_.notIntegrityProtected = 1 AND _f_.notIntegrityProtected
         = 1; *set*(ECT.element-list.element-map.measurement-values-
         map.flags.is-integrity-proteccted = FALSE).

      If _m_.notIntegrityProtected = 1 AND _f_.notIntegrityProtected
         = 0; *set*(ECT.element-list.element-map.measurement-values-
         map.flags.is-integrity-proteccted = TRUE).

      If _m_.notRuntimeMeasured = 1 AND _f_.notRuntimeMeasured = 1;
         *set*(ECT.element-list.element-map.measurement-values-
         map.flags.is-runtime-meas = FALSE).

      If _m_.notRuntimeMeasured = 1 AND _f_.notRuntimeMeasured = 0;
         *set*(ECT.element-list.element-map.measurement-values-
         map.flags.is-runtime-meas = TRUE).

      If _m_.notImmutable = 1 AND _f_.notImmutable = 1;
         *set*(ECT.element-list.element-map.measurement-values-
         map.flags.is-immutable = FALSE).

      If _m_.notImmutable = 1 AND _f_.notImmutable = 0;
         *set*(ECT.element-list.element-map.measurement-values-
         map.flags.is-immutable = TRUE).

      If _m_.notTcb = 1 AND _f_.notTcb = 1; *set*(ECT.element-
         list.element-map.measurement-values-map.flags.is-tcb = FALSE).

      If _m_.notTcb = 1 AND _f_.notTcb = 0; *set*(ECT.element-
         list.element-map.measurement-values-map.flags.is-tcb = TRUE).

   Step 4.  The ECT.authority field is set up based on the signer of the
            certificate containing DTI as described in Section 3.4.

   The completed ECT is added to the ae list.

3.2.  DiceUeid Transformation

   This section defines the transformation method for the DiceUeid
   certificate extension.  This extension is identified by the following
   object identifier:

   *  tcg-dice-Ueid - "2.23.133.5.4.4"

   Step 1.  An ae entry is allocated.

   Step 2.  The cmtype of the ECT is set to evidence.

   Step 3.  The DiceUeid entry populates the ae ECT environment-
            map.instance-id.tagged-ueid-type.  The CBOR tag #6.550 is
            prepended to the DiceUeid OCTET STRING then copied to
            ae.environment-map.instance-id.

   Step 4.  The ECT.authority field is set up based on the signer of the
            certificate containing DiceUeid as described in Section 3.4.

   The completed ECT is added to the ae list.

3.3.  DiceConceptualMessageWrapper Transformation

   This section defines the transformation method for the
   DiceConceptualMessageWrapper certificate extension.  This extension
   is identified by the following object identifier:

   *  tcg-dice-Ueid - "2.23.133.5.4.9"

   The DiceConceptualMessageWrapper entry OCTET STRING may contain a
   CBOR array, JSON array, or CBOR tagged value.  If the entry contains
   a CBOR tag value of #6.571 or #6.1668557429, or a Content ID of
   10571, or a Media Type of "application/ce+cbor", the contents are
   transformed according to Section 4.

3.4.  Authority field in DICE/SPDM ECTs

   The ECT authority field is an array of $crypto-keys-type-choice
   values.

   When adding Evidence to the ACS, the Verifier SHALL add the public
   key representing the signer of that Evidence (for example the DICE
   certificate or SPDM MEASUREMENTS response) to the ECT authority
   field.  The Verifier SHALL add the authority of the signers of each
   certificate in the certificate path of the end-entity signing key to
   the ECT authority list.  Having each authority in a certificate path
   in the ECT authority field lets conditional endorsement conditions
   match multiple authorities or match an authority that is scoped more
   broadly than the immediate signer of the Evidence artifact.

   Each signer authority value MUST be represented using tagged-cose-
   key-type.

4.  Transforming TCG Concise Evidence

   This section defines how Evidence from TCG [TCG.CE] is transformed
   into an internal representation that can be processed by Verifiers.

   Verifiers supporting the TCG Concise Evidence format SHOULD implement
   this transformation.

   Concise evidence may be recognized by any of the following registered
   types:

       +==========+========+===============+=======================+
       | CBOR tag | C-F ID | TN Tag        | Media Type            |
       +==========+========+===============+=======================+
       | #6.571   | 10571  | #6.1668557429 | "application/ce+cbor" |
       +----------+--------+---------------+-----------------------+

                                  Table 1

   A Concise Evidence entry is converted to a CoRIM ECT (see
   Section 8.2.1 of [I-D.ietf-rats-corim]) using the transformation
   steps in this section.  A list of Evidence ECTs (i.e., ae = [ + ECT])
   is constructed using CoRIM attestation evidence internal
   representation (see Section 8.2.1.1 of [I-D.ietf-rats-corim]).  The
   Concise Evidence scheme uses CoRIM CDDL definitions to define several
   Evidence representations called _triples_. Cases where Concise
   Evidence CDDL is identical to CoRIM CDDL the transformation logic
   uses the structure names in common.

4.1.  Transforming the ce.evidence-triples

   The ce.evidence-triples structure is a list of evidence-triple-
   record.  An evidence-triple-record consists of an environment-map and
   a list of measurement-map.  For each evidence-triple-record an ae ECT
   is constructed.

   Step 1.  An ae ECT entry is allocated.

   Step 2.  The cmtype of the ECT is set to evidence.

   Step 3.  The Concise Evidence (CE) entry populates the ae ECT
            environment fields.

      *copy*(CE.evidence-triple-record.environment-map,
         ECT.environment.environment-map).

   i  For each ce in CE.[ + measurement-map]; and each ect in ECT.[ +
      element-list]:

      *copy*(ce.mkey, ect.element-map.element-id)

      *copy*(ce.mval, ect.element-map.element-claims`)

   Step 4.  The signer of the envelope containing CE is copied to the
            ECT.authority field as described in Section 3.4.  For
            example, a CE may be wrapped by an EAT token
            [I-D.ietf-rats-eat] or DICE certificate [DICE.Attest].  The
            signer identity MUST be expressed using $crypto-key-type-
            choice.  A profile or other arrangement is used to
            coordinate which $crypto-key-type-choice is used for both
            Evidence and Reference Values.

   Step 5.  If CE has a profile, the profile is converted to a $profile-
            type-choice then copied to the ECT.profile` field.

   The completed ECT is added to the ae list.

4.2.  Transforming the ce.identity-triples

   The ce.identity-triples structure is a list of ev-identity-triple-
   record.  An ev-identity-triple-record consists of an environment-map
   and a list of $crypto-key-type-choice.  For each ev-identity-triple-
   record an ae ECT is constructed where the $crypto-key-type-choice
   values are copied as ECT Evidence measurement values.  The ECT
   internal representation accommodates keys as a type of measurement.
   In order for the $crypto-key-type-choice keys to be verified a CoRIM
   identity-triples claim MUST be asserted.

   Step 1.  An ae ECT entry is allocated.

   Step 2.  The cmtype of the ECT is set to evidence.

   Step 3.  The Concise Evidence (CE) entry populates the ae ECT
            environment fields.

      *copy*(CE.ce-identity-triple-record.environment-map,
         ECT.environment.environment-map).

      *copy*(_null_, ECT.element-list.element-map.element-id).

   i  For each cek in CE.[ + $crypto-key-type-choice ]; and each ect in
      ECT.element-list.element-map.element-claims.intrep-keys.[ + typed-
      crypto-key ]:

      *copy*(cek, ect.key)

      *set*( &(identity-key: 1), ect.key-type)

   Step 4.  The signer of the envelope containing CE is copied to the
            ECT.authority field.  For example, a CE may be wrapped by an
            EAT token [I-D.ietf-rats-eat] or DICE certificate
            [DICE.Attest].  The signer identity MUST be expressed using
            $crypto-key-type-choice.  A profile or other arrangement is
            used to coordinate which $crypto-key-type-choice is used for
            both Evidence and Reference Values.

   Step 5.  If CE has a profile, the profile is converted to a $profile-
            type-choice then copied to the ECT.profile` field.

   The completed ECT is added to the ae list.

4.3.  Transforming the ce.attest-key-triples

   The ce.attest-key-triples structure is a list of ev-attest-key-
   triple-record.  An ev-attest-key-triple-record consists of an
   environment-map and a list of $crypto-key-type-choice.  For each ev-
   attest-key-triple-record an ae ECT is constructed where the $crypto-
   key-type-choice values are copied as ECT Evidence measurement values.
   The ECT internal representation accommodates keys as a type of
   measurement.  In order for the $crypto-key-type-choice keys to be
   verified a CoRIM attest-key-triples claim MUST be asserted.

   Step 1.  An ae ECT entry is allocated.

   Step 2.  The cmtype of the ECT is set to evidence.

   Step 3.  The Concise Evidence (CE) entry populates the ae ECT
            environment fields.

      *copy*(CE.ce-attest-key-triple-record.environment-map,
         ECT.environment.environment-map).

      *copy*(_null_, ECT.element-list.element-map.element-id).

   i  For each cek in CE.[ + $crypto-key-type-choice ]; and each ect in
      ECT.element-list.element-map.element-claims.intrep-keys.[ + typed-
      crypto-key ]:

      *copy*(cek, ect.key)

      *set*( &(attest-key: 0), ect.key-type)

   Step 4.  The signer of the envelope containing CE is copied to the
            ECT.authority field.  For example, a CE may be wrapped by an
            EAT token [I-D.ietf-rats-eat] or DICE certificate
            [DICE.Attest].  The signer identity MUST be expressed using
            $crypto-key-type-choice.  A profile or other arrangement is
            used to coordinate which $crypto-key-type-choice is used for
            both Evidence and Reference Values.

   Step 5.  If CE has a profile, the profile is converted to a $profile-
            type-choice then copied to the ECT.profile` field.

   The completed ECT is added to the ae list.

5.  Transforming SPDM Evidence

   This section defines how Evidence from SPDM [SPDM] is transformed
   into an internal representation that can be processed by Verifiers.

   Verifiers supporting the SPDM Evidence format SHOULD implement this
   transformation.

   The SPDM measurements are converted to concise-evidence which has a
   format that is similar to CoRIM triples-map (their semantics follows
   the matching rules described above).  The TCG DICE Concise Evidence
   Binding for SPDM specification [TCG.CE] describes a process for
   converting the SPDM Measurement Block to Concise Evidence.
   Subsequently the transformation steps defined in Section 4.

   The keys provided in the ECT.authority field SHOULD include the key
   which signed the SPDM MEASUREMENTS response carrying the Evidence and
   keys which authorized that key as described in Section 3.4.```

6.  Implementation Status

   This section records the status of known implementations of the
   protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this
   Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in [RFC7942].
   The description of implementations in this section is intended to
   assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing drafts to
   RFCs.  Please note that the listing of any individual implementation
   here does not imply endorsement by the IETF.  Furthermore, no effort
   has been spent to verify the information presented here that was
   supplied by IETF contributors.  This is not intended as, and must not
   be construed to be, a catalogue of available implementations or their
   features.  Readers are advised to note that other implementations may
   exist.

   According to [RFC7942], "this will allow reviewers and working groups
   to assign due consideration to documents that have the benefit of
   running code, which may serve as Evidence of valuable experimentation
   and feedback that have made the implemented protocols more mature.
   It is up to the individual working groups to use this information as
   they see fit".

7.  Security and Privacy Considerations

   Evidence appraisal is at the core of any RATS protocol flow,
   mediating all interactions between Attesters and their Relying
   Parties.  The Verifier is effectively part of the Attesters' and
   Relying Parties' trusted computing base (TCB).  Any mistake in the
   appraisal process could have security implications.  For instance, it
   could lead to the subversion of an access control function, which
   creates a chance for privilege escalation.

   Therefore, the Verifier’s code and configuration, especially those of
   the CoRIM processor, are primary security assets that must be built
   and maintained as securely as possible.

   The protection of both the Attester and Verifier systems should be
   considered throughout their entire lifecycle, from design to
   operation.  This includes the following aspects:

   *  Minimizing implementation complexity (see also Section 6.1 of
      [I-D.ietf-rats-endorsements]);

   *  Using memory-safe programming languages;

   *  Using secure defaults;

   *  Minimizing the attack surface by avoiding unnecessary features
      that could be exploited by attackers;

   *  Applying the principle of least privilege to the system's users;

   *  Minimizing the potential impact of security breaches by
      implementing separation of duties in both the software and
      operational architecture;

   *  Conducting regular, automated audits and reviews of the system,
      such as ensuring that users' privileges are correctly configured
      and that any new code has been audited and approved by independent
      parties;

   *  Failing securely in the event of errors to avoid compromising the
      security of the system.

   The appraisal process should be auditable and reproducible.  The
   integrity of the code and data during execution should be made an
   explicit objective, for example ensuring that the appraisal functions
   are computed in an attestable trusted execution environment (TEE).

   The integrity of public and private key material and the secrecy of
   private key material must be ensured at all times.  This includes key
   material carried in attestation key triples and key material used to
   assert or verify the authority of triples (such as public keys that
   identify trusted supply chain actors).  For more detailed information
   on protecting Trust Anchors, refer to Section 12.4 of [RFC9334].

   The Verifier should use cryptographically protected, mutually
   authenticated secure channels to all its trusted input sources (i.e.,
   Attesters, Endorsers, RVPs, Verifier Owners).  The Attester should
   use cryptographically protected, mutually authenticated secure
   channels to all its trusted input sources (i.e., Verifiers, Relying
   Parties).  These links must reach as deep as possible - possibly
   terminating within the Attesting Environment of an Attester or within
   the appraisal session context of a Verifier - to avoid man-in-the-
   middle attacks.  Also consider minimizing the use of intermediaries:
   each intermediary becomes another party that needs to be trusted and
   therefore factored in the Attesters and Relying Parties' TCBs.  Refer
   to Section 12.2 of [RFC9334] for information on Conceptual Messages
   protection.

          "body": "If the evidence authority uses a $crypto-key-type-choice that is a cert chain, then the chain will contain the deviceID cert making the authority globally unique. \n\nHowever, there is a different issue you're describing (I think) which is how does the Attester uniquely identify itself to the Verifier. There are two parts to the attester-verifier session. Authentication (which should use the deviceID key) and evidence collection which should use whatever attestation keys are most appropriate for the evidence that is reported. It's best to think of these as different keys. \n\nNote there is a thread on RATS which is arguing for these keys being mandatorily separate as one of the researchers has identified this as a potential security flaw.\n\nThe way corim can express the identity of the attester is using instance-id in environment-map where the ID value references the deviceID key. This could be done using the DeviceID directly, or some variant of the $crypto-key-type-choice that includes the DeviceID key. The identity of the device could be one of the claims asserted as part of connection establishment (maybe the DeviceID cert should have a bit of evidence that makes this claim)? Remember when we discussed whether to use some of the cert fields as evidence but decided not to? The consequence of that decision is the identity of device needs to be repeated in the DiceTcbInfo fields for the instance-id claim to be tied to the deviceID. \n\nThe DiceTcbInfo.type field is an OCTET STRING: \"type \u2013 a machine readable description of the measurement.\" \n\nFor this to match a reference value environment-map.instance-id.$crypto-key-type-choice. It (OCTET STRING) needs to start with a CBOR tag. (Actually all measurement-map values start with a CBOR tag). But using $crypto-key-type-choice allows the devid cert to be used as a way to link the deviceID cert to the device and for any attestation key in the same device to be linked to the deviceID. \n\nNote: If the deviceID cert contains only the DiceTcbInfo.`type` value. The reference value needs to be able to match this evidence. Since the external representation of Ref-Val triple makes measurement-map mandatory, there needs to be a measurement also. In this particular case, it makes sense to repeat the DeviceID key in the measurement-values-map.$crypto-key-type-choice. We can document it this way this convention to avoid having to make a pedestrian change to DiceTcbInfo that puts the $crypto-key-type-choice value in there twice.\n\nNote: The $crypto-key-type-choice should probably not be a cert or cert-path form since the inclusion of the digest of the cert or path will affect the signature over the cert which is circular.\n\nThe internal representation doesn't mandate the existence of `element-list` (aka measurement-map) hence DiceTcbInfo.type could exists in an internal representation that populated only the environment. Hence, the duplicated value in measurement-values-map could be deleted for internal representation.\n\nNevertheless, the matching rules for evidence given instance-id.$crypto-key-type-choice with reference value having both instance-id.$crypto-key-type-choice and element-list.element-claims.$crypto-key-type-choice (where both values are the same) should still not trigger a processing error. \n\nThis will result in the Verifier being able to disambiguate Attesters based on the DeviceID credential, but not introduce some irregularity that requires the Verifier to start using certificate fields as if they were intended as Evidence.

Any information in a certificate could in theory be considered to be Endorsement claims. But there isn't a discipline for how to map X.509 v3 fields into an ACS.\n\nIn (a), a device ID cert could contain attestatation information (e.g., DiceTcbInfo). But since the signer is the mfg'r, not an Attesting Env, the claims are actually Endorsements. Typically, Device ID certs are embedded in the Attester and hence are often size optimized. Adding an `instance-id` in this way may be mixed for practical reasons.\n\nIn (b), there's no real way to add an instance-id using conditions that are based on class attributes since ever member of the class would end up with the same instance identifier. Unless, there are special rules Verifiers follow.\n\nIn (c), the Verifier searches the certificate/path as the matching criteria. The domain-type could be extended to include $crypto-key-type-choice which includes matching on subject public key / key thumbprint. Note: matching on UUID as device instance id is already supported. This can then result in the addition of an ACS entry for an environment-map.instance-id. If the instance ID is in the cert used to authenticate to the Verifier, then the link between Attester-Verifier session and the ACS can be pinned down. Subsequently, any conditional endorsement that is specific to an instance of the Attester can be expressed in terms of the Attester's instance-id without needing special processing rules expressed as prose in a spec or profile.",

The `claims-list` portion need not be populated.\n\nA conditional endorsement that matches on instance-id can now add to `claims-list` subsequently.\n\nA risk of automated behavior that inserts instance identifiers is if an entity wants to manage privacy by NOT populating instance-id / other instance identifiers, the automation becomes a hurdle that must be overcome.",

Prefer a particular format when inserting data into the evidence. Verifier will need to transform to that format during evidence import.\r\n2. Hope that all Verifiers will pick the same representation during evidence import and have the CoRIM author pick the format which their Verifier used\r\n3. Change the CoRIM spec to let verifiers perform certain supported transforms when matching authorities\r\nI chose option 1 but I think the other options could be made to work.\r\n\r\nWith option 1 as currently written, I don't think the CoRIM spec needs to mandate any transforms. Option 2 essentially requires transforms as otherwise it won't work when the evidence import in the verifier guesses incorrectly.\r\n\r\nI really don't like 2. I don't really have a preference for 1 or 3 - both require that the verifier does transforms, but at different points in the verification. I think 1 is simpler.",

              "body": "> what was to problem to be prevented here by excluding \"device-specific keys\"?\r\n\r\nOne of the primary goals of the Verifier is to keep track of who (key) said what. If we omit the key that actually said the claim, then it seems a basic promise of the Verifier is not achieved. If we include other keys that are transitively related to the \"who\" key, then we're allowing more context in terms of the who. Not a problem unless there's a privacy consideration. \r\n\r\nA lose end thought is given an `authority` has multiple members, it is less clear which key signed Evidence, and which key signed which cert which cert in the cert path. That context gets stripped as part of building the ECT. Is that ok? I suppose its possible to reconstruct the cert path based on the keys and application of a path building routine. \r\n\r\nFrom the perspective of a conditional endorsement, only the keys that are known to outside world are useful for constructing conditions. But there's no downside to keeping the others around except for added  resource footprint. I don't know if the spec can predict what defines \"outside\" since in cases like TEEs the TEE key is what's relevant but it may be dynamically created. However, there is an orchestrator that dynamically updates workload status too.\r\n\r\nThe normative should say that the key that directly signed the claim MUST be included, and the keys in the cert path to the root CA SHOULD be included.",

Since there isn't a crypto-key-type-choice for DER the verifier has to convert it to something or we should add DER to the list of possible formats. CoRIM policy is to let the author of the external representation pick. But that doesn't work here. However, if we pick COSE_Key there will be implementations using PQC that can't accommodate large key structures. Maybe they will want to use a keyid/fingerprint approach.  I don't think there is universal enough adoption of COSE that all implementations will agree to it. The CoRIM internal representation is only a suggestion, so justifying COSE based on the assumption that the intrep is CBOR won't hold up. My choice is option 4, which is add DER as a crypto-key-type-choice, and then document using DER (which is just a copy operation). It is still possible for implementations to do key translation as a way to improve robustness. But that seems pragmatically out of scope for CoRIM / evidence translation drafts at this point.",
